# Bug[#2](https://github.com/Rishabh-1000/QA-Level-3-Assignment-Task--Rishabh-Dubey/issues/5): None of the main navigation bar items navigate to the correct page

## **Description**

When clicking on any of the main navigation bar items in the [Pet Shop](https://pet-shop.buckhill.com.hr/), users should be navigated to the corresponding page. However, currently, none of the main navigation bar items are redirecting to the correct pages, causing the application to fail in directing users to the expected destinations

## **Steps to Reproduce**

1. Open the [Pet Shop](https://pet-shop.buckhill.com.hr/) application in a web browser.
2. Navigate to any page within the application.
3. Click on one of the main navigation bar items at the top of the page (e.g., "PROMOTIONS," "PRODUCTS," "BLOG").

## **Expected Behavior**

After clicking on a main navigation bar item, the application should navigate the user to the corresponding page associated with that menu item.

## **Actual Behavior**

Upon clicking on any of the main navigation bar items, the application fails to redirect the user to the expected page. Instead, the user remains on the current page, with no change in the URL or content displayed
